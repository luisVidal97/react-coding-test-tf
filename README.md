# React Conding Test - TF

This is a simple project developing using create-react-app. The project is divided into 2 parts.

1. The first part consists in recreate a focusable component, it means, a text input which focus attribute will be active if you pass a specific prop. [Take a glimpse.](https://luisvidal97.github.io/react-coding-test-tf/#/focusable-input)

2. The second part consists in show a list of random users with the following attributes: name, lastname, age, votes and slogan. At the begining you could find them with votes in the rango from 0 to 10, bute then you could vote for anyone you want. At the same time, the screen will show an ordering list of the candidates by votes and another ordered by age. All this data is fetching of the next api: [Random Users](https://randomuser.me/api/). The number of candidates depends on a parameter that you pass it through the route.
